## Upgrading Benefits with Hardox® 500 Tuf

### 40% LONGER WEAR LIFE

Hardox® 500 Tuf adds around 50 HBW of hardness compared to Hardox® 450. Case studies show that the extra hardness can deliver up to 40% longer wear life, and even more in some applications. This naturally makes a dumper body, container, mining tray, excavator bucket or any other wear-affected equipment more cost-effective.

**Examples of increased wear life by upgrading from Hardox® 450 to Hardox® 500 Tuf for different materials and sliding wear** (according to Hardox® WearCalc™):

| Material | Wear Life Increase |
|----------|-------------------|
| Basalt | 38% |
| Granite | 40% |
| Steel scrap | 27% |

### THINNER MAKES LIGHTER

You can use thinner wear steel when designing with Hardox® 500 Tuf instead of Hardox® 450, with the same or better service life. Thinner steel means lighter structures that can take more payload and increase your profitability.

**A 5 mm (0.197") plate of Hardox® 500 Tuf is 17% lighter than a 6 mm (0.236") plate of Hardox® 450.**

New design solutions naturally need to take buckling, deflection and fatigue strength into consideration.

### IMPROVED DENT RESISTANCE

Higher hardness equals higher yield strength. This in turn translates into higher dent resistance. Upgrading from Hardox® 450 to Hardox® 500 Tuf improves the dent resistance as shown in testing.

**Test Method:** A 300 kg (661 lbs.) weight is dropped from 2.8 m (9.2 ft.) onto a 600 x 600 mm (23 x 23") test plate.

**Results from impact drop tests:**

| Thickness [mm] | Dent Depth [mm] |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Hardox® 500 Tuf plates | 10-15% less dent depth |
| Hardox® 450 plates | Baseline comparison |

## Hardox® 500 Tuf in the Workshop

### WELDING

Hardox® 500 Tuf can be welded with all conventional arc welding methods for ordinary and high-strength steel. Use welding consumables with a yield strength of max. 500 MPa (72 ksi) and a sufficiently low hydrogen content of max. 5ml/100 g of weld metal.

#### Suitable Welding Consumables

Welding materials with these properties reduce residual stress levels in the joint and its sensitivity to cold cracking:

- **All solid wires** applied at MAG (GMAW) and TIG welding
- **MAG welding with flux cored wires (FCAW):** Certain types
- **MAG welding with metal cored wires (MCAW):** Certain types
- **SAW:** Basic types of fluxes in combination with solid wires

More detailed information regarding the hydrogen content of a certain brand can be attained from its manufacturer. SSAB provides examples of suitable welding consumables - contact techsupport@ssab.com.

#### Preheating Requirements

**Hardox® 500 Tuf** - Using heat input of 1.7 kJ/mm (43.2 kJ/inch) and weld metal hydrogen content of max. 5 ml/100 g:

| Single plate thickness mm (in.) | Preheat Temperature °C (°F) |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------|
| < 16 (0.630) | Room temperature* |
| 16.1-25.4 (0.6339-1.5) | 75 (167) |
| 25.5-35.0 (1.004-1.375) | 125 (257) |
| < 35.1 (1.382) | 150 (302) |

**Hardox® 450** - Using heat input of 1.7 kJ/mm (43.2 kJ/inch) and weld metal hydrogen content of max. 5 ml/100 g:

| Single plate thickness mm (in.) | Preheat Temperature °C (°F) |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------|
| < 25 (0.984) | Room temperature* |
| 25-39.9 (0.984-1.571) | 125 (257) |

*Room temperature (approx. 20°C/ 68°F).

**Important Notes:**
- For heat inputs between 1.0-1.69 kJ/mm (25.4-42.9 kJ/inch), the min. preheat temperature is raised by 25 °C (77 °F) in comparison to the values in the tables, except when no preheating is required.
- For heat inputs below 1.0 kJ/mm (25.4 kJ/inch) the preheating temperatures can be calculated by SSAB's software WeldCalc. A user license can be obtained through www.ssab.com, or by contacting SSAB.
- Preheating can be avoided by welding with austenitic stainless consumables according to type AWS 307 or AWS 309. Hydrogen content is not relevant when welding with stainless consumables.

### CUTTING

Oxy-fuel, plasma, laser and abrasive water jet (AWJ) are all suitable methods for cutting Hardox® wear plate.

#### Cutting Recommendations

| Grade | Plate thickness mm (in.) | Minimum preheating temp. °C (°F) | Max. allowable temp. °C (°F)* |
|-------|-------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Hardox® 500 Tuf | ≤ 38.1 (1.5) | No preheating | 225 (437) |
| Hardox® 450 | < 40 (1.576) | No preheating | 225 (437) |

*Maximum allowable temperature is the temperature which must not be exceeded by preheating or cutting, or a combination of these two processes, otherwise the hardness of the cut part will be reduced.

#### Maximum Cutting Speed (without preheating)

| Grade | Max. plate thickness mm (in.) | Cutting Speed |
|-------|------------------------------|---------------|
| Hardox® 500 Tuf | ≤ 25.4 (1) | No restriction** |
| Hardox® 450 | < 40 (1.576) | No restriction** |

**Please follow recommendations from the cutting equipment manufacturer.

**Note:** Preheating is not required as long as the ambient temperature is above 20°C (68°F).

### BENDING

#### Minimum Tool Radius and Die Opening Width

When the bend line is perpendicular or parallel to the rolling direction:

| Material | Thickness (t) mm (in.) | Transverse to rolling direction minimum R / t | Along rolling direction minimum R / t | Die opening width (W) minimum W / t |
|----------|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Plate** (Both grades) | t < 8 (0.315) | 3.0 | 3.5 | 12 |
| | 8 (0.315) ≤ t < 20 (0.787) | 3.5 | 4.5 | 14 |
| | t ≥ 20 (0.787) | 4.5 | 5.0 | 16 |
| **Sheet** (Both grades) | 3 (0.118) ≤ t < 4 (0.157) | 3.0 | 4.0 | 12 |
| | 4 (0.157) ≤ t ≤ 6 (0.236) | 3.0 | 3.5 | 12 |

#### SSAB Bending Formula©

To estimate the force needed during bending, all factors should be considered: bending length, plate thickness, die width, tensile strength, and the changing moment arm during bending. The peak load is assumed to be reached at a bend opening angle of 120° with normal friction (no lubrication). **Trial tests are always recommended.**

**Formula:**
```
P = (b × t² × Rm) / ((W - Rd - Rp) × 9,800)
```

Where:
- **P** = Bending force, tonnes (metric)
- **t** = Plate thickness, mm
- **W** = Die width, mm
- **b** = Bend length, mm
- **Rm** = Tensile strength, MPa
- **Rd** = Die entry radius, mm
- **Rp** = Punch radius, mm

**Important Notes:**
- Since the tensile strength is higher for Hardox® 500 Tuf, the required bending force is about **14% higher** than for a Hardox® 450 plate of the same thickness.
- A Hardox® 500 Tuf plate that is **6% thinner** than a Hardox® 450 plate is bent with the same force.
- A **5 mm (0.197") plate of Hardox® 500 Tuf requires a lower bending force** than a 6 mm (0.236") Hardox® 450 plate.

The SSAB Bending Formula© is verified by tests for 90° bends.
